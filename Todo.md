- Add "vistor book"
    - fade between different quotes
    - QR for users to submit a quote?

- Auto populate special public dates
    - Mothers/Fathers day
    - Bank holidays

- Allow config-specified layout
    - This should also allow multiple widgets of the same type - the `id` system should already allow for this (untested)

- Allow repeats of the same widget (with independent config)
