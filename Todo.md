- Add "vistor book"
    - Make second page for users to be able to submit messages
    - Make the link (and the QR code) on the main page work to get to the submission form
    - (stretch goal) Allow users to submit images

- Auto populate special public dates
    - Mothers/Fathers day
    - Bank holidays

- Allow config-specified layout
    - This should also allow multiple widgets of the same type - the `id` system should already allow for this (untested)

- Allow repeats of the same widget (with independent config)


Minor improvements:
- Merge `create_equal_grid` with `create_weighted_row` and generally improve the tools for generating layouts
